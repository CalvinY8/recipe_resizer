the recipe is usually the wrong size, and in imperial. </br>
It is tiresome to enter data into an online recipe resizer. </br>
This tool will take all lines, convert to metric and resize. </br>

USAGE: </br>
copy the recipe list from Allrecipes webpage into a txt file. </br>
specify parameters in main() </br>
press run. </br>
